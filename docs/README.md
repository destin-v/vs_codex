ðŸ“„ Documentation
================

This repository contains two types of auto-documentation:

* [**Sphinx**](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A **powerful** documentation framework that allows users to create *beautiful* web-based layouts.
* [**Pdoc**](https://pdoc.dev/) : A **minimal** documentation framework that allows users to create *simple* web-based layouts.

[Sphinx Book Theme](https://sphinx-book-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) provides beautiful documentation based on the [Edward Tufte's](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) design principals.  Sphinx is considered the gold standard in documentation but requires a lot of up-front investment.  If you are building a bigger project, this is the recommended framework to use.

[Pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/) is the bare minimum expected for small projects.  Pdoc automatically creates documentation based on the comments and typing found in your code.  There is very little work needed to setup Pdoc as it will simply work.
